# MA_Lotto_check
Python script to check Mega Millions, Powerball, Lucky for Life, and Megabucks Doubler numbers to the results on www.masslottery.com. 

# Inspiration
This script was created to check the results for the office lotto pool season tickets. I grew tired of checking the numbers every day so I created this script to do it for us. The script can be modified to email the results to a distribution list.

# How to use
1. Copy lotto.py and tickets.txt to your computer. 
2. Run lotto.py from a terminal
3. the results will print to the screen
4. modify tickets.txt to include your season ticket numbers. Update the script to add or remove a game or to email the results
5. set the script to run every day
